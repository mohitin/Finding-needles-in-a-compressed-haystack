# Finding-needles-in-a-compressed-haystack
This repo contains the course project for CS754- Advanced Image Processing.\
**Problem Description:**
\
In this project I had reproduced the results of the paper " finding needles in a cmpressed haystacks" which introduced compressed learning, a
linear dimensionality reduction technique for measurement-domain pattern recognition in compressed sensing applications. They showed that a large family
of compressed sensing matrices satisfy the required properties. Along with the Delsarte geothal matrix, I had also implemeted bernaulli matrix with DCT basis.
\
**Dataset used :** Original Broadatz and CIFAR 10.
\
**Algorithms used:** SVM and ANN.
\
**Note:** Code is implemeted on google colab (.ipynb) notebook, so for better visualization of results open "Project_AIP.ipynb" using Google colab.
